As a designer in this US based fintech startup with cross-functional teams working around the globe, my role involved closely working with the key stakeholders to identify user expectations and pain points and how it affects business. We relied on human-centric design framework and worked in Agile to find MVP and increments. Regular design operations included conducting research, creating wireframes and prototypes, designing visual interfaces, and iterating based on feedback to ensure the product met both user and business needs. Additionally, I was responsible for ensuring brand consistency across the product and working closely with developers to ensure designs were implemented accurately and efficiently.
