    <p>A wip Research prjoect led by Dr. LaShonda from Pennsylvenia State University where I worked on the infographics. Multiple small projects.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic, characterized by unprecedented loss of life; political instability; and a global infodemic, has eroded public trust in all types of institutions (Edelman, 2021) except business. Public health efforts at managing the pandemic have consequently suffered as political polarization and rampant online misinformation has undermined the uptake of critical preventive measures such as masking and vaccinating (Nehum, et al., 2021). These challenges have created an opportunity for public health organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization to rebuild public trust by demonstrating a renewed commitment. “Nothing builds trust more than fulfilling a public commitment – and nothing erodes trust more than failing to meet it,” (Samson, 2021). COVID-19’s onset coupled with the aforementioned dwindling trust pose a shrouded public health threat and significant challenge for health and risk communicators. Therefore, these communicators must develop communication strategies not only to prevent and mitigate trust erosion, but also to restore and conserve the public’s trust. Furthermore, extreme “weather” factors such as: increased polarization and politicization (Vallier, 2020); volatile social climates (Berrada, 2018); mis- and dis-information (van der Meer, T. G., &amp; Jin, Y., 2020); historical crisis “footprints” (Eaddy, 2021); and political instability (Nunn et al., 2021) create the perfect storm that exacerbates trust erosion. Public-facing health organizations are particularly vulnerable to trust erosion (Samson, 2021), as their relationships with publics are often matters of life and death. Their inability to address trust erosion could potentially result in fatalities and unintended societal consequences. Understanding the trust erosion process is integral to keeping the public safe and allowing these important organizations to continue fulfilling their public health and safety missions. This study proposes a new Trust Erosion Framework, grounded in extant trust scholarship and ongoing industry discussion, to describe and explain the trust erosion phenomenon and associated processes. Moreover, the study provides insight for health and risk communicators regarding the prevention, mitigation, conservation and restoration of trust among the public.</p>
